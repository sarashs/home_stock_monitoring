# home_stock_monitoring

An openAI API key as well as NewsAPI API keys are needed.

The current MVP will be developed as follows based on catgpt recomendation:

1. **Data Acquisition (`data_acquisition.py`)**: The first module you need to create is the data acquisition module, as it provides the basic data needed for the rest of the project. 

2. **Data Processing (`data_processing.py`)**: Once you have raw data, you can process it to a format that's more suitable for analysis. This often involves cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, normalization, and so forth.

3. **Database Setup (`stock_data.db`)**: Parallelly, you should set up your SQLite database for storing the data. You can define the schema and test basic operations like insert, update, select, etc.

4. **Sentiment Analysis (`sentiment_analysis.py`)**: Once you have the raw news articles and SEC reports, you can work on analyzing the sentiment of the text. This involves calling the OpenAI GPT API, so you'll need to handle API requests and responses.

5. **Analytics (`analytics.py`)**: With processed data and sentiment results, you can perform further analytics like calculating financial ratios or identifying trends.

6. **Dashboard (`dashboard_app.py`)**: Lastly, once you have the processed data and insights ready, you can start building the dashboard that will display the results.

7. **Airflow Setup (`stock_monitoring_dag.py` and `airflow.cfg`)**: This might not be needed for the initial MVP. However, as your pipeline becomes more complex, you'll want to have Airflow set up to manage the workflows and dependencies between tasks.

8. **Containerization (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`)**: Once all the services are ready and tested individually, you can write the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to containerize the application and its dependencies. 

By focusing on these areas in this order, you will be able to incrementally build up the functionality of your system, testing and validating each component as you go along.

Here's a suggested directory and file structure for your project:

```

├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/            # for storing raw data (optional)
│   └── processed/      # for storing processed data (optional)
│

└── run.py                    # main script to run the entire pipeline
```

Let's break down what each file/module will do:

1. **`data_acquisition.py`**: This Python script will have functions to fetch data from Yahoo Finance, SEC API, and the News API.

2. **`data_processing.py`**: This script will contain functions to clean and process raw data.

3. **`sentiment_analysis.py`**: This script will host the functions for analyzing sentiment of news articles and SEC reports using OpenAI GPT API.

4. **`analytics.py`**: This script will have functions to calculate various metrics and insights.

5. **`dashboard_app.py`**: This is the Dash application script for your dashboard.

6. **`stock_monitoring_dag.py`**: This is the Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) definition file. It will use the Python Operators to call the functions defined in your modules in the correct order and handle dependencies.

7. **`run.py`**: This is your main script which will initiate the Airflow service and the Dash application.

8. **`Dockerfile`**: This file will have instructions to set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and start the services.

9. **`docker-compose.yml`**: This file will include services like your application and Apache Airflow. 

10. **`stock_data.db`**: This is your SQLite database file which will be stored on your local machine.

By modularizing your code like this, you're ensuring that your project is organized, scalable, and maintainable.
